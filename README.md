### Description

Lull is a desktop application that will mute your computer while Hulu plays ads.

Lull is simple to use. Download and run it - no installation required! 

Written in Node.js, it uses [RobotJS](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs) to read pixel colors for ad detection.

Currently only Mac and Linux are supported, but [Windows](https://github.com/octalmage/lull/issues/6) will be supported soon.

### Instructions

1. Download and run Lull.
   * Lull will run in the background, don't expect any feedback after opening the app (except for a tray icon). 
2. Watch Hulu in your browser fullscreen.
    * Lull won't be able to detect the ads if Hulu isn't fullscreen.
3. Enjoy Hulu without the annoying ads!
